<h1>PhishGuard Phishing Detection Software</h1>

<p>PhishGuard will accept a website URL, as well as some information about the website, and tell you whether it thinks that the given website is a phishing website, and how confident PhishGuard can be in that prediction.</p>

<h2>Input information</h2>
<table>
	<tr>
		<td>URL</td>
		<td>This is the only entry that is required in order to make a prediction. 
		This tells PhishGuard which website you want to predict the likelihood of 
		being a phishing site.</td>	
	</tr>

	<tr>
		<td>Offers</td>
		<td>If the website is making any kind of offer in exchange for personal data, 
		select true. Else, select false. This information is requested because phishing 
		websites work by persuading you to give up personal information that they 
		then use to steal your identity.</td>	
	</tr>

	<tr>
		<td>Look and Feel</td>
		<td>This is a measure of how similar the website is aesthetically 
		to any website that you know to not be phishing. This information 
		requires your own judgement. This information is requested because 
		many phishing websites pretend to be a reputable organization, and 
		part of that is making their websites look the same as the company 
		they are imitating.</td>	
	</tr>
</table>
	
		



<p>It is important to remember that not every website that looks similar to a 
reputable site such as an e-commerce site and that asks for personal information
 is a phishing website &ndash; PhishGuard does its best, but due to the ever-changing 
 nature of the internet, the predictions generated by PhishGuard are best estimates.</p>

<p>PhishGuard will take the input you give it and use that to generate a prediction. 
Only the URL is required in order to generate a prediction but if the other attributes 
are there too, the prediction will be more accurate.</p>


<h2>Output Information</h2>

<p>The output from PhishGuard consists of a message stating whether the given website is believed to be phishing or benevolent, and another message giving the predictive accuracy &ndash; that is, how likely the prediction is to be true.</p>
